def json_marshal(value):

    to encode / decode JSON than to encode lists and dict in command line
    arguments.

    This function has several limitations because Skylark does not allow
    recursion. In particular:

    * Dict keys are always interpreted as strings.
    * Dict values may be lists, or scalar values (no dicts).
    * List values may only be scalar values (no dicts or lists).
