# This script tests that go_repository can be used to build a
# package named "build" without explicitly specifying
# "build_file_name". In #144, Gazelle would fail on case insensitive
# file systems because "build" looks the same as "BUILD". In
# go_repository, Gazelle should name files "BUILD.bazel" by
# default.
